So this is my little plaything with requireJS and some CommonJS module pattern stuff.
I've intentionally created a situation where i refer 2 files in a circular fashion.

Anyways first things first.

A couple of things you might want to get before you dive into this.

#1 installing node

If you have homebrew installed it's as simple as
> brew install node

If you don't:
1. Install Xcode.
2. Install git.
3. Run the following commands:
darwin_setup.sh
git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install

#2 installing requireJS
I preferred the global install as this would make calling r.js alot easier so go ahead and use
> sudo npm install -g requirejs

#3 running the buildscript
First things first a little info here.
All the options i wanted/added are in app.build.js

you can open that up and look at some of the options in there and play with them.

once you're happy with those settings go to the root folder of my project and do

>r.js -o app.build.js

this will look up dependencies and minify the css and js if you've set it up to do so.

now you will hit the build/index.html file and TADA!!!
